# OptionsSheet

This application is built with pySimpleGUI. The idea is to provide an environment where it is easy to intuitively explore/fiddle 
with options contracts, pricing models and plot basic options positions (i.e. long/short positions, strangles, butterflies, etc.)

Given a ticker, the program will webscrape available options contracts from yahooFinance. You'll be able to edit inputs like the risk free rate and the
number of days to consider when calculating historic volatility. Other than that it's fairly simple, I hope you find it useful!
