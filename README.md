# OptionsSheet

Watch the Program Summary video for a brief demo of the program and its functions (click on the file "WATCH ME_Progrm Summary.mp4" and then click "view raw" to watch the video, you don't have to download it to watch)!

This application is built with pySimpleGUI. The idea is to provide an environment where it is easy to intuitively explore/fiddle 
with options contracts, pricing models and plot basic options positions (i.e. long/short positions, strangles, butterflies, etc.)

Given a ticker, the program will webscrape available options contracts from yahooFinance. You'll be able to edit inputs like the risk free rate and the
number of days to consider when calculating historic volatility. 

Enjoy!
